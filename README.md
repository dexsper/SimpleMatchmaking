# Simple Matchmaking

## About 
> An analogue of the service [Unity Matchmaker](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/matchmaker/manual/matchmaker-overview), that completely repeats their [Rest Api](https://services.docs.unity.com/matchmaker/v2/index.html) but without `delete ticket`
> <br>
It can be used in demo projects or serves for a basic understanding of the operation of such a system

## Motivation
> Unity Matchmaking does not currently allow you to work with your servers or Unity Relay(P2P) but in this solution, the host player decides which server address to connect to
